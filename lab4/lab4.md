**My ruleset URLs**\
[temperature_store]()

**questions**
1. 
2. I use array.any to test for duplicates, then array.filter to exclude those duplicates
3. _provides_ gives access to functions when used as a module. If _provides_ doesn't list the temperatures function, it won't be available when this ruleset is used as a module
4. _shares_ gives access to functions through sky/cloud queries.  if _shares_ doesn't list the temperatures function, it won't be accessible throuh sky/cloud queries.
